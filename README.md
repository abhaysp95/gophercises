# gophercises

My attempt of solving gophercises problems. There are 3 additional branches with prefix of `solution`.

* **solution_pt1:** contains part1 solution. If there's only one part then this branch will have the solution and will be merged with master

* **solution_pt2:** contains part2 solution. Generally this branch is merged with master

* **solution_pt3:** contains additional ideas solutions or sometimes additional work mentioned to update with or both. This branch is not merged with master at all. You can use diff with master to see what's updated in this branch
